[Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) for setting up [pixi](https://pixi.sh/) projects with all the necessary features for modern python development.

## Features
- Packaging with [pixi](https://prefix.dev/)
- Environment loading with [direnv](https://direnv.net/)
- Formatting and linting with [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff)
- Static typing with [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/)
- Testing with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)
- Git hooks that run all the above with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- Continuous integration with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- Code coverage with [Codecov](https://docs.codecov.com/docs)


## Setup
While all of the steps are automated, you will need to first install `pixi`, `cookiecutter`, and `direnv`, and optionally install the [GitHub-CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

```sh
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
pixi global install cookiecutter direnv

# Optional
curl -sS https://webi.sh/gh | sh
```
See [notes.md](notes.md#Project-Tools) for optional dependencies and [alternative installation methods](notes.md#Alternative-installation-methods).

```sh
# Use cookiecutter to create a project from this template
cookiecutter gh:jevandezande/pixi-cookiecutter
```

The cookiecutter will automagically
- Generate a project with the input configuration
- Initialize git
- Setup environment
- Setup pre-commit and pre-push hooks
- Make initial commit
- Sets up remote on GitHub (optional)


## Recommendations
- Make a custom config file (see [template_config.yml](template_config.yml)).
- Install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to run GitHub Actions locally.
- Install [direnv](https://pixi.sh/latest/integration/third_party/direnv) to automagically load the environment.

Read [notes](notes.md) for more tips.

If you are interested in using Poetry to manage your project, checkout [poetry-cookiecutter](https://github.com/jevandezande/poetry-cookiecutter), which served as a template for this cookiecutter.
